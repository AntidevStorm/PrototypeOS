# Hello!

Hello and welcome to the _largest project I will ever publishe_! That may not sound like much to ***you***, since I haven't provided any other examples, but I have published some _laaaaargeeeeeee_ (magnitude) projects before! This is still small as to what I expect it to be once I release it to it's full and first 1.0 version (In perspective, it's around 0.2 right now), and then keep giving it updates until I give it a serial name and switch to making (Serial Name) 2. As expected, some come here to download it, which is completely fine, but some come here to learn how I did something like this, and that is why I added annotations (Marked in <!--x-->, // x and /*) Enjoy! If you do want to help me make (Serial Name) 2, message me on Discord; gigastalin_
