# Voxos


# Hello!

Hello and welcome to the _largest project I will ever publish_! That may not sound like much to ***you***, since I haven't provided any other examples, but I have published some _laaaaargeeeeeee_ (magnitude) projects before! This is still small as to what I expect it to be once I release it to it's full and first 1.0 version (In perspective, it's around 0.13 right now), and then keep giving it updates until I switch to making Voxos 2. As expected, some come here to download it, which is completely fine, but some come here to learn how I did something like this, and that is why I added annotations (Marked in <!--x-->, // x and /*) Enjoy! If you do want to help me make Voxos 2, message me on Discord; gigastalin_ or 
# What is PrototypeOS?
Great question! PrototypeOS is a `web-based OS Prototype (duh) that emulates an Operating System, but doesn't require the tedious installations and partitions, and doesn't alter the host system!` It now has `a name!` It is called `Voxos`.

# Update
_As of this moment_, the experimentals are more advanced than the original, lol. `I know this will fall apart in some way, lmao.`
Gave it a name, Voxos
Original version is now called "Legacy version". Use it if you want to see the old files or just if the new ones don't work!
# Bugs

## 1.

> Because of a `Hard-coded` bug I will fix, the installation will just freeze at 100%. At this point, just press `Skip` and you will load into the Main interface of the OS!

# Complaints

## 1. Kind of blank, no icons, no theme.........FIXED!

> `I know!` Everyone should know that `design never goes first in these large projects.` I always make the `core structures, then the additions, then the design. I am working on a new CSS prototype so I will add a folder and a copy of the main code in there as the 'Experimental' version.` You may download it and tell me your thoughts!

## 2. There will be more functions.....right?

> `Of course there will!` As I stated above, we're only about 13% done not including styles and additions `(If we are, then we're about 4% done)` so be patient and I will deliver a great VoxOS!

## 3. Why can I see the BIOS on the taskbar lol?

> That was actually an `experimental feature I decided to keep in for now;` if the majority doesn't like it I'll take it out of the original and add a seperate version that still has it!
